I studied Sociology and Computational Linguistics, bringing together my interest in Computational
Social Science. Driven by sociological curiosity and rapidly-developing technological opportunities, I like to investigate the past, the current, and the future of society at small and large scale. Moreover, I possess a strong passion for natural language processing (NLP), enabling new forms of retrieving and extracting information from vast text collections using state-of-the-art techniques.

Currently, I work as Software Engineer at [Textshuttle](https://www.textshuttle.ai/) building highly customized and cross-lingual language technology. Additionally, I teach at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/n) as a guest lecturer introducing methods of computational text analysis to students of social science and promoting digital literacy.

Get in touch. I am happy to answer questions, learning about your projects or just have a talk about coffee, beer and other important ingredients of life.
